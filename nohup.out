However, this would leave us little time to sort out any discrepancies before running into the 14 month end stop and therefore my current preference is to delay PIT until April which would mean the Euratom PIV would  then be conducted in May.\n\n\n\nWould this proposed arrangement of an April PIT and May PIV be suitable for Tradebe?’\n\n\n\n\n\nI have let Bob know that both Charlie Mitchell and Chris Dale are very supportive of this proposal.\n\n\n\nI suggest we close the action on the ATDb as we have met the requirement to  ‘Explore with the Magnox Southern Sites NMC the possibility of re-phasing the semi-annual stocktakes to avoid the busy March period’."], ["closeout", "A above"], ["source", "S&E"], ["created_at", 2017-02-09 12:40:56 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-09 12:40:56 UTC], ["closed_flag", true]]

However, this would leave us little time to sort out any discrepancies before running into the 14 month end stop and therefore my current preference is to delay PIT until April which would mean the Euratom PIV would  then be conducted in May.\n\n\n\nWould this proposed arrangement of an April PIT and May PIV be suitable for Tradebe?’\n\n\n\n\n\nI have let Bob know that both Charlie Mitchell and Chris Dale are very supportive of this proposal.\n\n\n\nI suggest we close the action on the ATDb as we have met the requirement to  ‘Explore with the Magnox Southern Sites NMC the possibility of re-phasing the semi-annual stocktakes to avoid the busy March period’."], ["closeout", "A above"], ["source", "S&E"], ["created_at", 2017-02-09 16:33:50 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-09 16:33:50 UTC], ["closed_flag", true]]

To keep the system safe and intact the tubing would need to be replaced every two year and is susceptible to snagging and deforming through heat caused by a greenhouse effect. \n\nA quotation has been received for replacing the existing degrading system with 90m of stainless steel tubing and all items that will be needed to carry out this task. \n\nIt will take longer to fit the stainless steel however  this is the cheaper option in the long run. Purchase has been approved by the Interim Site Manager. \n\nFrom: Ian Tanner \n\nThe replacement system will be installed parallel to the existing system and once in place will be swopped over.

Thereafter we would carry out an annual review of the baseline in line with your earlier recommendation i.e. focus on any changes to the baseline and the vulnerability assessment.
