INTRO

Name - "SHEQ_APPS"

It is intended to develop prototype applications for information and workflow 
management within the Safety, Health, Environment and Quality function.

Information used in this development environment to seed the database must not
include any company specific information.

This App is developed by Andrew Hampson (SHEQ Manager at Tradebe Inutec, 2016)

PURPOSE

Tracking, reporting and administration of various related SHEQ functions is 
currently achieved through separated databases and spreadsheets. This is labour 
intensive and inefficient in the application of SHEQ team time. Also there is a 
lack of USER ENGAGEMENT, DATA VISIBILITY, and ACCOUNTABILITY in the current SHEQ
processes.

SHEQ_APPS seeks to provide a single point interface for staff, managers, SHEQ 
and administration to manage the SHEQ processes. This application if successful
will be hosted locally on the company intranet.
